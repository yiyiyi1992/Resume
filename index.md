## Research interests
 In general, my research interests are the following:
-	Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in tumor microenvironment (TME). I’d like to (1) study the modulation of TAM survival, polarization, and recruitment in TME and (2)explore the mechanisms underlying TAM-facilitated metastasis.
-	The role of T lymphocytes in tumor growth. I’d like to understand(1) the molecular mechanisms responsible for the compromised T cell function in the TME and (2) CD4+ T cell-mediated tumor rejection. 
-	Cancer genomics & proteomics. I’d like to use/develop experimental and computational methods to investigate the genomic and proteomic alterations in cancer.

## Research Experience
### [** Yu's Lab, Institute of cancer research, Shenzhen Bay laboratoty, China**](https://www.szbl.ac.cn/index_en.aspx)  `2020.10-`
_Research assistant_<br>
My project researches the biological history of CAR-T Cells using a CRISPR recorder in order to combat CAR-T cell dysfunction.
### **Taam's Lab, Centre for Inflammation Biology & Cancer Immunology, King’s College London** `2019.04 - 2020.04`

_PhD student_<br>
  Research Topic: Investigating the functional consequences and molecular basis of monocyte modulation mediated by T regulatory cells
-	Designed the experiments to reveal the modulation of Treg mediated-monocyte phenotype by low-dose IL-2 treatment
-	Performed antibody titration experiments and detected the activity of hr IL-2 with pSTAT5 staining and T cell proliferation assay 
-	Isolated Tregs through cell sorting and performed co-culture of monocytes with Tregs 
-	Applied flow cytometry to observe the phenotypic changes and ELISA to detect cytokine production in Treg-mediated monocytes with or without IL-2 stimulation
-	Generated histogram and density plots to analyse FACS data using FlowJo
-	Performed pathway analysis software, IPA, to analyse the RNAseq dataset of Treg-mediated monocytes; selected pathways and target genes 

### **Yu's Lab, Department of Pharmacy & Medicine, Ocean University of China** `2015.9 - 2018.8`

_Master student_<br>
  Postgraduate Thesis Project: Immunomodulatory mechanisms on macrophages of a β-1,3/1,6-d-glucan (BG136) extracted from Durvillaea antarctica
-	Studied the immunomodulating effects of macrophages by BG136 via measuring the phagocytosis function, ROS and NO release, cytokine production and pathway activation (NF-kB, MAPKs) in macrophages.
-	Through the mechanistic study, it’s found that (1) BG136 binds to cell surface with FITC-labeled BG136; (2) BG136 binds to TLR4 on macrophages with a strong binding affinity determined by SPR technique; (3) BG136 modulates macrophage activity through TLR4 using siRNA technique.
-	Studied the anti-tumor effects of BG136 on MCF-7 breast cancer tumor-bearing nude mice; the anti-tumor effects were measured by tumor volume, tumor weight, splenic index and peripheral CD4/CD8 ratio of tumor-bearing mice.


### **Zhu's Lab, Jiangsu Research Institute for Chinese Medicine** `2014.9 - 2015.6`

_Research Assistant_<br>
-	Investigated the anti-inflammation effects of Nauclea Officinalis extract on macrophages
-	Learned experimental design, biology statistics, compound isolation, cell culture techniques and experimental techniques on mice (tail bleeding and retro orbital blood withdrawal); I co-authored in two publications resulted from this work.
