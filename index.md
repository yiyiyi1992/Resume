## Research Experience

### **Centre for Inflammation Biology & Cancer Immunology, King’s College London** `2019.04 - 2020.04`

_Ph.D student_<br>
  Research Topic: Investigating the functional consequences and molecular basis of monocyte modulation mediated by T regulatory cells
-	Designed the experiments to reveal the modulation of Treg mediated-monocyte phenotype by low-dose IL-2 treatment
-	Performed antibody titration experiments and detected the activity of hr IL-2 with pSTAT5 staining and T cell proliferation assay 
-	Isolated Tregs through cell sorting and performed co-culture of monocytes with Tregs 
-	Applied flow cytometry to observe the phenotypic changes and ELISA to detect cytokine production in Treg-mediated monocytes with or without IL-2 stimulation
-	Generated histogram and density plots to analyse FACS data using FlowJo
-	Performed pathway analysis software, DAVID and IPA, to analyse the RNAseq dataset of Treg-mediated monocytes; selected pathways and target genes 

### **Department of Pharmacy & Medicine, Ocean University of China** `2015.9 - 2018.8`

_Master student_<br>
  Postgraduate Thesis Project: Immunomodulatory mechanisms on macrophages of a β-1,3/1,6-d-glucan (BG136) extracted from Durvillaea antarctica
-	Studied the immunomodulating effects of macrophages by BG136 via measuring the phagocytosis function, ROS and NO release, cytokine production and pathway activation (NF-kB, MAPKs) in macrophages.
-	Through the mechanistic study, it’s found that (1) BG136 binds to cell surface with FITC-labeled BG136; (2) BG136 binds to TLR4 on macrophages with a strong binding affinity determined by SPR technique; (3) BG136 modulates macrophage activity through TLR4 using siRNA technique.
-	Studied the anti-tumor effects of BG136 on MCF-7 breast cancer tumor-bearing nude mice; the anti-tumor effects were measured by tumor volume, tumor weight, splenic index and peripheral CD4/CD8 ratio of tumor-bearing mice.


### **Columbia University, Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab** `2017.1 - 2017.5`

_Research Assistant_<br>
Worked with prof. Steven Feiner, on **Cyber Affordance Visualization in Augumented Reality** project. Developed a Microsoft Hololens application that visualizes the Columbia campus in AR environment.
